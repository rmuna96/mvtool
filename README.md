# Mitral Valve (MV) tool

## Extract morphological metrics from multi-class segmentation of mitral valve from 3D ultrasound.

This repository is intended to be used to validate the performance of deep learning models for automatic mitral valve 
segmentation from 3D ultrasound by automatically measuring metrics commonly used in the clinic to characterize mitral 
valve morphology.
